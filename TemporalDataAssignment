This assignment is concerned with visualizing some form of temporal data, using d3.js and.or related javascript libraries.
You may complete this assignment using any form of data that illustrates change or pattern over a given time period.

Of course there are many other sources for inspirartion, including Mike Bostock's site and many others, but this should 
serve as a start. if you get stuck on visualizing temporal data, you may look at time series data as well, in which case 
you may wish to look at cubism.js, rickshaw.js, and others.
